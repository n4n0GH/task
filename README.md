# task
Task allows you to quickly create to-do lists by typing them without any additional frizz.

Write anything into the input field and see it added as a new item.

## What this
### is
A simple todo manager that allows you to focus on getting your todo list done instead of working out how to work your todo list. It's your piece of paper on your screen.

In fact, here's a comparison between paper and task:

Feature | Task | Paper
--- | --- | ---
What you write is what you get | Yes | Yes
Automatically converts text to timestamps | Yes | No
Let's you remove tasks easily | Yes | Depends
Works without electricity | No | Yes
Can use darkmode | Yes | No
Uses trees as base resource | No | Yes
Neighbors can find your notes in the trash | No | Yes
Written in Snekspeak | Yes | No
Requires a pen or pencil to use | No | Yes
Can create dynamic groups of items according to due date without running out of paper | Yes | No

### isn't
A planner for tasks and subtasks, categories, tags, or collaborative editing. It's not meant to replace more complex tools, but if you're looking for something that's a little prettier than simple text files, this is for you.

## Features
- Any input is regarded as a new task unless it's a specific command
- Writes tasks and settings into a seperate json file so you could sync it with other machines
- Doesn't require you to learn weird input syntax, commands or grow additional arms to get your shit done
- Doesn't slow you down when writing new tasks
- Does one thing and does it well
- Not bloated

## What about
### Org-Mode?
Org-Mode is a very versatile and complex system available for a myriad of interfaces, emacs being the most famous implementation. It's way more than what I needed so I made task.

### that other tool I like?
There are a lot of TUI based todo or task applications out there but none of them are as lean as I wanted them to be. Hell, some are even written in NodeJS and require a metric fuckton of bloat to be installed with the tool just to be able to use it. No thanks.
