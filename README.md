# task
Task allows you to quickly create to-do lists by typing them without any additional frizz. Write anything into the input field and see it added as a new item.

## Features
-Any input is regarded as a new task unless it's a specific command
-Writes tasks and settings into a seperate json file so you could sync it with other machines
-Doesn't require you to learn weird input syntax or commands to get your shit done
-Doesn't slow you down when writing new tasks
-Does one thing and does it well
-Not bloated

## What about Org-Mode?
What about it? Org-Mode is a very versatile and complex system available for a myriad of interfaces, emacs being the most famous implementation. It's way more than what I needed so I made task.

## What about <other thing>?
There are a lot of TUI based todo or task applications out there but none of them are as lean as I wanted them to be. Hell, some are even written in NodeJS and require a metric fuckton of bloat to be installed with the tool just to be able to use it. No thanks.
